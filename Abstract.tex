Exascale supercomputing represents many revolutionary changes in the
hardware and software of high-performance computing.  One of the most
pressing issues is the transport of simulation results data to a meaningful
analysis.  The traditional workflow prescribes storing the simulation
results to disk and later retrieving them for visualization and data
analysis.  However, at exascale we will be unable to write a sufficient
amount of results data to perform a proper analysis.  This work explores
two alternate workflows, characterized as \insitu and \intransit, and
compares them.  We find each to have its own merits and faults, and we
provide information to help pick the best option for a particular use.
