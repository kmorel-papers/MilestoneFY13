Exascale supercomputing represents many revolutionary changes in the
hardware and software of high-performance computing.  One of the most
pressing issues is the transport of simulation results data to a meaningful
analysis.  The traditional workflow prescribes storing the simulation
results to disk and later retrieving them for visualization and data
analysis.  However, at exascale, scientists and analysts will need additional
options for getting data to persistent storage, as the current offline or 
post-processing pipelines will not be able to capture the data 
necessary for analysis of these extreme scale simulations.
This Milestone explores
two alternate workflows, characterized as \insitu and \intransit, and
compares them.  We find each to have its own merits and faults, and we
provide information to help pick the best option for a particular use.
