Milestone 4745, Data Co-Processing for Extreme Scale Analysis, is
successfully completed on time and demonstrated against the letter and
spirit of the stated Milestone.

Visualization and data analysis on extreme scale platforms presents
critical challenges in the management of data generated by simulations and
the interface between simulation and data analysis.  Computation speed will
continue to outpace storage bandwidth, and power management will become
much more of a workflow constraint on advanced architectures, so we
anticipate that science on extreme scale machines will require a range of
data analysis, filtering, and visualization workflows.  With these tools, the
analysts will determine 
the best computation profile for specific problems.  In particular, in 
addition to current
practices of post-processing and constrained writes, customers will need
\insitu and \intransit workflows that allow them flexible options for
getting results to persistent storage.

Milestone 4745 provides important study of the behavior of new workflows
for \vda.  In particular, we examine the performance of two proposed
workflows: an \insitu workflow in which \vda is coupled directly with a
simulation as a library, and an \intransit workflow in which \vda is a separate
service connected to the simulation via a network.  Each workflow has its
own characteristics, and our study details empirical evidence on their
respective performances.

For milestone 4745 we employ two critical software technologies developed
with significant contributions from Sandia National Laboratories.  First,
we use the Catalyst library to provide \insitu \vda directly to a running
simulation.  Second, we use the Nessie framework to establish an \intransit
\vda service connected to a running simulation.

Our empirical study comprises over 10 million core hours of running an
instrumented simulation and data analysis use case.  This use case, involving
the fragmentation analysis of an explosion simulated in the CTH shock
physics code, is designed in conjunction with a Sandia analysis customer as
an exemplar of scientific work.

In addition to demonstrating the scalability of our frameworks, our study
also provides insightful comparisons between the \insitu and \intransit
workflows and the trade-off point between them.  We also consider other
important parameters such as memory overhead, initialization time, and
scheduling.

This SAND report presents the full results of our milestone work and is
available to anyone.
