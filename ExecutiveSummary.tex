Milestone 4745 Data Co-Processing for Extreme Scale Analysis was successfully completed on time, and demonstrated against the letter and spirit of the stated Milestone.

\begin{quote}
\begin{em}
SNL will engineer, test and evaluate customer-driven operations on a large-scale data created by a running simulation.  The data operations will be performed by both in-situ and in-transit solutions
\end{em}
\end{quote}

Both in-situ (Catalyst) and in-transit (Nessie) analysis capabilities were engineered, tested and evaluated by coupling with CTH running a fragmentation problem, provided by a Sandia analyst, at scales up to 64k cores on Cielo.

Though simply stated, this represented the bulk of the development work on the Milestone, requiring that the in-situ and in-transit capabilities by developed, engineered and tested at scale.

\begin{em}
The resulting performance data published and made available to the ASC community.

Proof:  The full results have been published in a SAND report, and is available to anyone.
