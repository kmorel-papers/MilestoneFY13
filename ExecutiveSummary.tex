Milestone 4745 Data Co-Processing for Extreme Scale Analysis was successfully completed on time, and demonstrated against the letter and spirit of the stated Milestone.

Both in-situ (Catalyst) and in-transit (Nessie) capabilities were tested on a user-provided CTH problem, in over nine (9) million node hours of runs on Cielo.  The results are presented here, with conclusions and timeline for further development.

The full results have been published in a SAND report, and is available to anyone.
