	Abstract = {The 9/30/2009 ASC Level 2 Scalable Analysis Tools for Sensitivity Analysis and UQ (Milestone 3160) contains feature recognition capability required by the user community for certain verification and validation tasks focused around sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification (UQ). These feature recognition capabilities include crater detection, characterization, and analysis from CTH simulation data; the ability to call fragment and crater identification code from within a CTH simulation; and the ability to output fragments in a geometric format that includes data values over the fragments. The feature recognition capabilities were tested extensively on sample and actual simulations. In addition, a number of stretch criteria were met including the ability to visualize CTH tracer particles and the ability to visualize output from within an S3D simulation.},

@inproceedings{Fabian2012,
	Abstract = {We explore the problem of characterizing fragments using ParaView in situ with an explosion simulation. By running in situ we can see a much higher temporal view of the data as well as potentially compress the output to only those statistics about fragments we care about. However, the fragment finding must be able to scale as well as the simulation. In order to achieve the necessary scales, we borrow operations the simulation is already doing and take advantage of them within ParaView, demonstrating the resulting improvement in scaling performance.},
