	Abstract = {The most common abstraction used by visualization libraries and applications today is what is known as the visualization pipeline. The visualization pipeline provides a mechanism to encapsulate algorithms and then couple them together in a variety of ways. The visualization pipeline has been in existence for over twenty years, and over this time many variations and improvements have been proposed. This paper provides a literature review of the most prevalent features of visualization pipelines and some of the most recent research directions.},

@inproceedings{EAVL,
	Abstract = {The coming generation of supercomputing architectures will require fundamental changes in programming models to effectively make use of the expected million to billion way concurrency and thousand-fold reduction in per-core memory. Most current parallel analysis and visualization tools achieve scalability by partitioning the data, either spatially or temporally, and running serial computational kernels on each data partition, using message passing as needed. These techniques lack the necessary level of data parallelism to execute effectively on the underlying hardware. This paper introduces a framework that enables the expression of analysis and visualization algorithms with memory-efficient execution in a hybrid distributed and data parallel manner on both multi-core and many-core processors. We demonstrate results on scientific data using CPUs and GPUs in scalable heterogeneous systems.},
	Annote = {Provides an overview of EAVL, mult-core, many-core, GPU, exascale thinking system.  EAVL defines operations with the use of functors.  Current operations look limited to basic mapping operations that can look at topological connections.  The really unique thing about EAVL is its data model that can adapt to many topological features and can handle things like edge and face data.  It also seems like it can map pretty easily to these features.},

@techreport{PISTON,
	Abstract = {Due to the wide variety of current and next-generation supercomputing architectures, the development of highperformance parallel visualization and analysis operators frequently requires re-writing the underlying algorithms for many different platforms. In order to facilitate portability, we have devised a framework for creating such operators that employs the data-parallel programming model. By writing the operators using only data-parallel primitives (such as scans, transforms, stream compactions, etc.), the same code may be compiled to multiple targets using architecture-specific backend implementations of these primitives. Specifically, we make use of and extend NVIDIA's Thrust library, which provides CUDA and OpenMP backends. Using this framework, we have implemented isosurface, cut surface, and threshold operators, and have achieved good parallel performance on two different architectures (multi-core CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs) using the exact same operator code. We have applied these operators to several large, real scientific data sets, and have open-source released a beta version of our code base.},
	Annote = {A library providing portable implementations of visualization algorithms on multi- and many-core processors.  Uses Thrust to implement algorithms and portability.  Compares marching cubes isosurface generation to existing implementations by NVIDIA and VTK.

I believe this was presented at EGPGV 2012 and when it becomes available in the proceedings this reference should be updated.
