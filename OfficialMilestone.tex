\fix{Wrap this in a description?  Perhaps also add what is ``meant'' by
  this milestone?  Tie it in to the rest of the document to outline how
  this success criteria is demonstrated?}

ASC calculations produce complex datasets that are increasingly difficult to explore and understand using traditional post-processing workflows.  To advance understanding of underlying physics, uncertainties, and results of ASC codes, SNL must gather as much relevant data as possible from large simulations.  This drives SNL to couple data analysis and visualization capability with a running simulation, so that high fidelity data can be extracted and written to disk.  This Milestone evaluates two approaches for providing such a coupling:

\begin{enumerate}
\begin{item}
In-situ processing provides ``tightly-coupled'' analysis capabilities through libraries linked directly with the simulation.  SNL has collaborated on developing an in-situ capability designed for this purpose.
\end{item}
\begin{item}
In-transit processing provides ``loosely-coupled'' analysis capabilities by performing the analysis on separate processing resources.  SNL provides this capability through a ``data services'' capability designed for this purpose.
\end{item}
\end{enumerate}

SNL will engineer, test and evaluate customer-driven operations on large-scale data created by a running simulation.  The data operations will be performed by instrumented versions of both the in-situ and in-transit solutions, with the resulting performance data published and made available to the ASC community.

A program review will be conducted, and its results documented.  A report will be submitted as a record of milestone completion.
